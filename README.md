## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for subscription-based businesses. This project aims to:

- Understand customer behavior through visualizations.
- Identify patterns and correlations in the data.
- Build predictive models to classify churned vs. retained customers.
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- `CustomerID`
- `Age`
- `Gender`
- `Tenure`
- `Usage Frequency`
- `Support Calls`
- `Payment Delay`
- `Subscription Type`
- `Contract Length`
- `Total Spend`
- `Last Interaction`
- `Churn` (Target variable)
